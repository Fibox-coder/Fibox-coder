Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tim and I'm a Front End Webdeveloper who loves to work with JavaScript technologies. Right now my mind is focused on learning everything related to the process of Web Development and Web design. 

At the moment I'm mainly learning to improve my React and TypeScript skills.
